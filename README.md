## Introduction: what this repository contains.
The repository is 'funddata-assessment' and in there you will find normal-distribution.ipynb which id the jupyter notebook for the Project.
You will also find exam_results.csv. There is a folder called **exercises** which has all the five jupyter notebooks for the assesments :

- 01-information-exercises.ipynb  
- 03-bias-exercises.ipynb      
- 05-cleansing-exercises.ipynb 
- 02-randomness-exercises.ipynb   
- 04-outliers-exercises.ipynb

There is also the morley.csv, iris.data and exam_results.csv datasets.

## Setup
***
I use a windows 10 laptop with python 3.7, CMDER and Anaconda installed. 
You can find Anaconda at the following website :
https://www.anaconda.com/

You can find Cmder at the website :
https://cmder.app/

You will need to pull the github repository https://github.com/loughjo/funddata-assessment/ down to your local machine.


## How to get the code running
***
Once cmder is started up you should be able to got to the directory path where you have downloaded the **funddata-assesment**
repository and in the funddata-assesment you will find the normal-distribution.ipynb and folder **exercises** which contains
the jupyter notebooks for teh assements.

From here you can run **jupyter notebook** and it will navigate to a browser where you can click on the normal-distribution.ipynb
or you can navigate into the exercises folder and open any of the assessment jupyter notebooks.
